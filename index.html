                        <h5>
                            <b>Behavioural economics</b>, as the psychology behind economic activities(2),
                            is founded upon the basis of choice(3).
                            <b>Spatial behavior</b>, as a our problem domain, is defined from the 
                            perspective of
                            aversiveness and indifference to proximity(4), eg. if opportunities within a
                            constrained <b>spatial range</b> are evaluated
                            only in terms of attraction attributes, then the individual’s
                            <b>spatial choices</b> may be <b>spatially indifferent</b>(4).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            However, there exists a <b>variety-seeking tendency</b>, that is an intrinsic
                            tendency to engage a variation in
                            behavior as a goal in and of itself, such variations are known as
                            <b>variety-seeking behavior</b>(5).
                            And yet, <b>spatial indifference</b> is bounded by constraints of willingness
                            to traverse space over a certain <b>spatial range</b> to a set of opportunities
                            that are <b>spatially finite</b>.
                        </h5>
                        </br>
                        <h2>Philosophy, Motive, Approach & Hypothesis</h2>
                        <h5>
                            Our choice of a <b>philosophy</b> is that: <i>"the intuitive grasp of the 
                                essentials of
                                a large complex of facts leads to a basic 'law', from which, as a system
                                of axioms, we may derive conclusions"</i>(7). 
                            And as such, even that our chosen domain is foreign to us,  
                            we understand that the key to traverse 
                            its complex to 
                            the clarity of the simple, is studying 
                            its ubiquitous language's(8) most essential of constructs, and that is 
                            the notion of behavior.
                            On key <b>motive</b>, and with a software engineering background; 
                            we address 
                            an actor class of our 
                            problem domain with a software artifact, 
                            to <b>approach</b> our designated notion. 
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            We set our <b>hypothesis</b> as that the economic actor class of spatial 
                            choice variety

                            within a specified <b>spatial range</b> defined in terms of

                        <h5>
                            While data acquisition is out of our scope, we needed
                            demo data to demonstrate our project.
                            Our demo data is sampled from <b>Google's
                                Places</b> and <b>MatrixDistance API Endpoints</b>.
                            For simplicity, we maintain a wide schema,
                            until we reach the visualization stage.
                            <br>
                            e.g. filtered.csv -> cardinal.csv -> stats.csv -> (visualization)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We filter our acquired data by a specified maximum walking duration, as
                            a constraint of our <b>spatial range</b> and store it
                            as filtered.csv, while keeping the original data separately.

                        <h5>
                            First, we used our origin/destinations data to calculate to which
                            cardinal direction each destination belongs.
                            We used R's GeoSphere
                            <i>bearingRhumb()</i> function.
                            And we relaxed the cardinal accuracy of the destinations to provide a useful
                            abstraction of a walking direction choice.
                            </br>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/openbsd1337/c587aa57198be59b9e8c2db15d1735ef.js"></script>
                            We calculate our descriptive statistics of each cardinal e.g.
                            standard deviations, means, and coefficient of variations; as for each
                            cardinal direction we may represent walking duration <b>spread</b> 
                            via the coefficient of variations,
                            <b>spatial proximity</b> via the mean and 
                            <b>spatial variety</b> via the destination count.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            However, we choose to scope our current work only to the use of destination 
                            counts
                            within a specified spatial range at each direction, 
                            as a guiding score
                            for spatial variety.

                            <b>Information Visualization</b> is the process that provides a capability,

                            </br>
                            1. We provided our users with a spatial orientation via the use of a map.

                            2. We offered a map's legend to color associate a spatial direction with

                            </br>
                            3. We represented walk duration proximity via size, the bigger the radius
                            of a destination circle, the closer it is to origin.
                            </br>

                            Spatial indifference is bounded by constraints of willingness to traverse
                            space over a certain range, and regardless of variety-seeking behavior,
                            the set of opportunities considered by an individual when making a
                            spatial choice are spatially finite. We employed cardinal directions and
                            destination counts to offer, through spatial visual constructs of color and
                            size, each walking direction opportunities.

                           
                                And as we are spatial choice variety seekers ourselves, we find that our 
                                utility yeilds, 
                                more than Google Maps, 
                                a visually instant
                                answer to the question: 
                                <i>Which walking direction(s) would offer more opportunities for 
                                    a spatial choice variety seeker?</i>
                                and hence we accept our hypothesis.

                        <h5>
                            During our project we experimented with the idea of having a cardinal
                            ranking based on a function of: walking duration spread via the coefficient 
                            of 
                            variations, spatial proximity via the mean and spatial variety via the 
                            destination count. 
                            </br>
                            We also realized that our ranking may be suitable for comparing several
                            origins and their respective cardinal directions, which could
                            lead to interesting applications. Nevertheless, we deemed it out
                            of our current scope.
                            An idea that we couldn't conclude due to our project's time constrain.
                            And yet we are remain interested in its possible applications in 
                            various domains e.g. real estate.
                            Therefore we would like to pursue by intiating relevant litreature reviews
                            in the areas of geostatistics,
                            spatial analysis, and  
                            spatial economics.
