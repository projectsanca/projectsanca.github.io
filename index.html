                            <b>Behavioural economics</b>, as the psychology behind economic activities(2),
                            is founded upon the basis of choice(3).
                            <b>Spatial behavior</b> is defined from the perspective of
                            aversiveness and indifference to proximity(4), eg. if opportunities within a 
                            constrained <b>spatial range</b> are evaluated
                            only in terms of attraction attributes, then the individual’s
                            <b>spatial choices</b> may be <b>spatially indifferent</b>(4).
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            However, there exists a <b>variety-seeking tendency</b>, that is an intrinsic 
                            tendency to engage a variation in 
                            behavior as a goal in and of itself, such variations are known as 
                            <b>variety-seeking behavior</b>(5). 
                            And yet, <b>spatial indifference</b> is bounded by constraints of willingness 
                            to traverse space over a certain <b>spatial range</b> to a set of opportunities 
                            that are <b>spatially finite</b>.

                            opportunities considered by an individual

                            Data Acquisition
                        </h2>
                        <h5>
                            While data acquisition is out of our scope, we needed 
                            demo data to demonstrate our project.
                            Our demo data is sampled from <b>Google's 
                                Places</b> and <b>MatrixDistance API Endpoints</b>. 
                            For simplicity, we maintain a wide schema, 
                            until we reach the visualization stage.
                            <br>
                            e.g. filtered.csv -> cardinal.csv -> stats.csv -> (visualization)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We filter our acquired data by a specified maximum walking duration, as 
                            a constrain of our <b>spatial range</b> and store it
                            as filtered.csv, while keeping the original data separately.

                            Cardinal Direction Ranking 
                        </h2>
                        <h5>
                            First, we used our origin/destinations data to calculate to which 
                            cardinal direction each destination belongs. 
                            We used R's GeoSphere 
                            <i>bearingRhumb()</i> function.
                            And we relaxed the cardinal accuracy of the destinations to provide a useful 
                            abstraction of a walking direction choice.
                            </br>
                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/openbsd1337/c587aa57198be59b9e8c2db15d1735ef.js"></script>
                            We calculate our descriptive statistics: standard deviation, mean, and 
                            coefficient of variation; as we may represent walking duration spread via CV, 
                            spatial proximity via the mean and spatial variety via the destination count.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            We choose to scope our current work to the use of, destination counts 
                            within a specified spatial range at each direction, as a guiding score 
                            of variety for spatial choice variety seekers.
                            </br>
                            </br>
<!--
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Now that we can recommend a walking direction. 
                            We need to measure the walk duration variability at each direction in order to 
                            rank our cardinal directions for spatial choice variety seekers. 
                            The <b>coefficient of variation (CV)</b> was our start, as 
                            it is to often used to determine the existing variations of different 
                            variables because it shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Yet, CV alone proved to be insufficient as we also need to minimize the 
                            walking duration of our users while also offering them the highest number of 
                            destinations, thus we added the inverse of the
                            mean as well as the total count of destinations to our equation.  

                            Next, we normalized all our quantities(cv for variability, mean for proximity, count 
                            for variety). And because now they are all of equal weights, we biased our
                            equation towards variety by the multiplication of a constant.
                            <b>
                                Cardinal Direction Score 
                            </b>equals  
                            <b>
                                (1/normalized mean of OD walking durations at the direction)

                            + 
                            <b>
                                (normalized total count of destinations at the direction * a variety bias constant)
                            </b>
                            + 
                            <b>
                                (1/OD walking durations normalized CV at the direction), 
                            </b>
                            which gives us a score for each direction, 
                            that we used to rank the directions according to variety bias.

                            of a destination circle, the closer it is to origin.

                        <h5>
                            Spatial indifference is bounded by constraints of willingness to traverse 
                            space over a certain range, and regardless of variety-seeking behavior, 
                            the set of opportunities considered by an individual when making a 
                            spatial choice are spatially finite. We employed cardinal directions and 
                            destination counts to offer, through spatial visual constructs of color and 
                            size, each walking direction opportunities.
